📅 Day 12 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Template Literals** — one of the coolest modern JavaScript features that makes working with strings super easy and readable! ✨

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Using backticks (`) to create strings  
- Inserting variables using ${variable}  
- Writing multi-line strings cleanly  
- Embedding expressions directly inside strings  
- Formatting output and building message templates  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Template literals make string concatenation cleaner and more readable  
- Multi-line strings are effortless — no more "\n" everywhere  
- You can insert calculations, functions, and objects inside ${ }  
- Great for building formatted messages, UI content, logs, and notifications  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 12 completed!  
This feature made string handling feel modern and elegant.  
Template literals are definitely going to be a huge part of my upcoming JavaScript projects! 🚀

🎯 Next Target (Day 13):
➡️ Dive into **MINI PROJECT SIMPLE CALCULATOR** — storing and managing multiple values efficiently.
