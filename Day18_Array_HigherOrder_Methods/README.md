📅 Day 18 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Higher Order Array Methods** in JavaScript — some of the most powerful tools for transforming, filtering, and analyzing data in a clean and functional way. 🔥

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Using map() to transform array items  
- Filtering data with filter()  
- Summarizing values using reduce()  
- Searching with find()  
- Checking conditions with some() and every()  
- Chaining multiple methods together for cleaner code  
- Working with arrays of objects  

🔍 What I Learned:
- map() is great for creating new transformed arrays  
- filter() helps extract only the values we want  
- reduce() is extremely powerful for totals and calculations  
- find() returns the first matching item  
- some() checks if any item passes a condition  
- every() checks if all items meet a condition  
- Method chaining makes code shorter, cleaner, and more readable  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 18 completed!  
Today felt like a real level-up — higher-order functions are used everywhere in modern JavaScript, from APIs to UI rendering to data processing.  
Understanding these tools makes code more efficient and expressive. 💪🚀

🎯 Next Target (Day 19):
➡️ Explore **forEach, find, some, every** individually and understand where each one fits best in real projects.
