📅 Day 29 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **DOM Selectors** — the tools that help JavaScript find and target elements inside a webpage.  
Understanding selectors is essential for creating interactive UI, updating content, and adding dynamic behavior. 🔍✨

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Selecting elements using:
  ➜ getElementById  
  ➜ getElementsByClassName  
  ➜ getElementsByTagName  
  ➜ querySelector  
  ➜ querySelectorAll  
- Exploring HTMLCollection vs NodeList  
- Selecting nested elements  
- Looping through selected elements  
- Changing content and styles dynamically  
- Handling missing/incorrect selectors safely  

🔍 What I Learned:
- querySelector() and querySelectorAll() are the most flexible and modern  
- getElementById is fastest and perfect for single unique elements  
- NodeList supports forEach(), HTMLCollection does not  
- Checking if an element exists prevents runtime errors  
- DOM selectors are the foundation for all event handling and manipulation  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 29 completed!  
Today’s practice helped me understand how JavaScript actually interacts with webpage elements.  
DOM selectors make it possible to build dynamic UI, validate forms, show/hide elements, and respond to user interactions.  
Feeling more confident in DOM manipulation! 💪🔥

🎯 Next Target (Day 30):
➡️ Learn **DOM Manipulation** — creating, removing, updating, and styling elements using JavaScript.
