📅 Day 5 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I learned about **Conditional Statements** in JavaScript — the logic behind how programs make decisions! 🧠

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Understanding how `if`, `else if`, and `else` work
- Writing programs that behave differently based on conditions
- Using **comparison** and **logical operators** inside conditions
- Exploring the **ternary operator** for short, one-line decisions

🔍 What I Learned:
- Conditional statements allow programs to react to different inputs and situations
- Learned the difference between multiple `if-else` blocks and nested conditions
- Practiced writing simple programs like grade calculators and login checks
- Used ternary operators to make code shorter and cleaner

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 5 completed!
Today was all about making my code “think.” 🧠  
It felt great to control how the program responds to different scenarios using `if`, `else if`, and `else`.  
Every line of logic now feels like a step toward building real-world applications! ⚡

🎯 Next Target (Day 6):
➡️ Explore **Loops** — repeating tasks efficiently using `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops in JavaScript!
