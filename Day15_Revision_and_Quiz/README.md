📅 Day 15 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Debugging and Comments** in JavaScript — two essential skills that help identify issues, understand code better, and keep programs clean and error-free. 🐞🔧  

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Using console.log() to inspect values  
- Understanding common debugging methods  
- Using console.warn() and console.error()  
- Fixing logical errors by checking outputs  
- Writing clean comments for better readability  
- Learning how try/catch helps handle runtime errors  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Debugging is not just finding errors — it's understanding how the code flows  
- console.log() is a powerful tool to test variables and logic  
- Clear comments help make code readable for future me (and other developers!)  
- try/catch prevents programs from crashing and helps handle unexpected inputs  
- Even simple debugging steps can save hours of confusion  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 14 completed!  
Today’s learning felt practical — debugging is a daily skill for every developer.  
Understanding how to test, trace, and fix code made me feel more confident and in control of my JavaScript journey. 💪✨

🎯 Next Target (Day 16):
➡️ Work on **Array Basic** — revising all concepts from Days 1–14 and doing self-assessment questions.
