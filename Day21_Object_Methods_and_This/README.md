📅 Day 21 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I learned about **Object Methods** and the **this keyword** in JavaScript — the concepts that bring objects to life and make them behave like real-world entities. 🚀

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Creating methods inside objects  
- Calling methods using dot notation  
- Understanding how `this` refers to the current object  
- Using methods to update object properties  
- Difference between function methods vs arrow functions inside objects  
- Accessing nested object methods  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Methods allow objects to perform actions (like functions inside an object)  
- `this` always refers to the object that is calling the method  
- Arrow functions don’t bind `this` — useful to remember during debugging  
- Methods help make objects more dynamic and interactive  
- Nested objects can have their own methods using `this` inside them  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 21 completed!  
This topic really helped me understand how objects behave internally.  
Learning how `this` works is a big step toward writing cleaner and more professional JavaScript code.  
I feel a lot more confident working with interactive objects now! 💪✨

🎯 Next Target (Day 22):
➡️ Explore **Nested Objects** — storing complex data structures inside objects.
