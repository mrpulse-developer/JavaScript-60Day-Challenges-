📅 Day 24 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored the **Spread and Rest Operators** — two powerful features in modern JavaScript that make working with arrays, objects, and function parameters much easier and cleaner. 🚀

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Using spread (...) to copy arrays & objects  
- Merging multiple arrays into one  
- Cloning objects without reference issues  
- Converting NodeLists/strings into arrays  
- Using rest (...) to handle unlimited function arguments  
- Combining both for flexible code  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Spread operator is perfect for expanding arrays and objects  
- Rest operator helps collect values into arrays inside functions  
- These tools remove the need for loops in many cases  
- Used in React props, Node.js APIs, array merging, and more  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 24 completed!  
These operators make JavaScript feel modern and super clean.  
Now I can merge, copy, and pass data in a far more elegant way!  

🎯 Next Target (Day 25):
➡️ Build a **Mini Project: Student Record Manager** using all the concepts learned so far.
