📅 Day 28 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I learned about the **DOM (Document Object Model)** — the bridge between JavaScript and the webpage.  
DOM allows us to select elements, update content, change styles, create new elements, and respond to user actions.  
Basically, it gives JavaScript the power to interact with the UI. 🌐⚡

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Understanding what DOM actually is  
- Selecting elements using:
  ➜ getElementById  
  ➜ querySelector  
  ➜ querySelectorAll  
- Updating text, attributes, and styles through JavaScript  
- Creating and adding new HTML elements dynamically  
- Removing elements from the page  
- Adding click and submit event listeners  
- Handling form input and user interactions  

🔍 What I Learned:
- DOM is the backbone of interactive web pages  
- querySelector() makes selecting elements extremely flexible  
- Creating elements with createElement() feels powerful  
- appendChild() and remove() help build dynamic UI  
- Event listeners are essential for building responsive front-end features  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 28 completed!  
Today’s topic made JavaScript feel “alive” — I finally understand how websites react to clicks, input, and dynamic content.  
DOM manipulation is a core skill for frontend development, and I’m excited to build more interactive components! 💪🔥

🎯 Next Target (Day 29):
➡️ Explore **DOM Selectors** in more depth and understand how to target elements efficiently.
