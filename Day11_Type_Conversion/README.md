📅 Day 11 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Type Conversion** in JavaScript — understanding how values change from one data type to another. This is super important for validating user input, handling form data, and preventing unexpected bugs. 🔄🧠

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Converting strings to numbers using Number(), parseInt(), parseFloat()
- Converting numbers to strings using String() and toString()
- Boolean conversion and understanding truthy/falsy values
- Automatic type coercion when mixing different data types

🔍 What I Learned:
- `"10" + 5` becomes `"105"` because JS converts the number to a string  
- `"10" - 5` becomes `5` because JS converts the string to a number  
- Boolean("") → false, Boolean("hello") → true  
- NaN appears when JS fails to convert a value into a number  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 11 completed!  
It was great to understand how JavaScript handles data behind the scenes.  
Now I can avoid tricky bugs and write cleaner, more predictable code. 💪

🎯 Next Target (Day 12):
➡️ Explore **Template Literals** — a modern way to create cleaner and more readable strings.
