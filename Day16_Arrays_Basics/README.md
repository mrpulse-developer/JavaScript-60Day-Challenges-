📅 Day 16 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I learned about **Array Basics** — one of the most essential data structures in JavaScript!  
Arrays help store multiple values in a single variable, making data management super easy. 📦✨

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Creating arrays  
- Accessing elements using indexes  
- Updating array values  
- Checking array length  
- Adding items manually  
- Looping through arrays with for and for..of  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Arrays are ordered and can store mixed data types  
- Using indexes makes accessing data fast  
- Loops make it easy to print and work with list data  
- for..of creates cleaner and more readable loops  
- Arrays are the foundation of data handling in JS  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 16 completed!  
Understanding arrays unlocked a new level in JavaScript.  
Most real-world programs use arrays heavily — so this foundation is important!  

🎯 Next Target (Day 17):
➡️ Dive into **Array Methods** — push(), pop(), splice(), map(), filter(), reduce(), and much more.
