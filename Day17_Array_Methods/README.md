📅 Day 17 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Array Methods** — the tools that make JavaScript arrays powerful, flexible, and extremely useful in real-world applications. These methods help add, remove, search, transform, and filter data easily. 📦⚙️

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Adding/removing items with push(), pop(), shift(), unshift()
- Searching with indexOf() and includes()
- Extracting arrays using slice()
- Modifying arrays using splice()
- Joining elements with join()
- Sorting and reversing arrays
- Using map(), filter(), and reduce() for data transformation

🔍 What I Learned:
- push() and pop() are perfect for stack-like behavior
- splice() is extremely powerful for inserting and removing items at specific positions
- map() helps transform each item into something new
- filter() helps pick only the values we want
- reduce() is like a mini powerhouse — great for sums, totals, and calculations

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 17 completed!  
Array Methods made JavaScript feel more dynamic and expressive.  
These tools are used everywhere — from filtering products to calculating totals in real-world apps.  
Feeling super confident with array manipulation now! 💪🔥

🎯 Next Target (Day 18):
➡️ Explore **Higher Order Array Methods** — chaining map(), filter(), reduce(), and writing cleaner, more functional code.
