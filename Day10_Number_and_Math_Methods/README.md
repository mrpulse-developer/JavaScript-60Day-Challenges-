📅 Day 10 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Number and Math Methods** in JavaScript — essential tools for calculations, data formatting, random numbers, and numeric validation. 🔢⚙️

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Formatting numbers using toFixed(), toPrecision(), and toString()
- Converting strings to numbers using Number(), parseInt(), parseFloat()
- Using Math methods like round(), floor(), ceil(), abs(), pow(), sqrt()
- Generating random numbers with Math.random()

🔍 What I Learned:
- JavaScript provides powerful built-in methods to work with numbers efficiently
- Math.random() can create everything from game logic to OTP generators
- toFixed() is great for decimals, especially in money-related apps
- parseInt() and parseFloat() help convert user inputs into usable numeric data

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 10 completed!
Today’s lesson made JavaScript feel more practical — these math and number tools are used everywhere in real-world applications.  
From forms to calculations to UI formatting, numbers play a huge role in programming! 💪

🎯 Next Target (Day 11):
➡️ Dive into **Type Conversion** — learning how JavaScript automatically and manually converts data types.
