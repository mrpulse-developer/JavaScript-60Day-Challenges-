📅 Day 23 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I learned about **Destructuring** — a modern and clean way to extract values from arrays and objects.  
It makes code shorter, readable, and easier to manage. ✨

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Array destructuring  
- Object destructuring  
- Renaming variables during destructuring  
- Default values to avoid undefined  
- Nested destructuring  
- Destructuring inside functions  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Destructuring removes repetitive code  
- Easily extract values like:  
  const { name, age } = user  
- Quick swapping using array destructuring  
- Works perfectly for API data and complex objects  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 23 completed!  
Destructuring instantly made my code cleaner and more professional.  
This feature is widely used in real-world JS projects — especially React, Node.js, and API responses.  

🎯 Next Target (Day 24):
➡️ Learn **Spread & Rest Operators** — more tools to handle arrays, objects, and function parameters easily.
