📅 Day 9 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

💛 JavaScript Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **String Methods** in JavaScript — one of the most powerful tools for working with text, formatting messages, and building dynamic UI! ✨  

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Finding string length and accessing characters  
- Converting text to uppercase/lowercase  
- Concatenating strings using + and template literals  
- Searching inside strings using includes(), startsWith(), endsWith()  
- Extracting text using slice() and substring()  
- Replacing text and removing extra spaces with trim()  
- Splitting strings into arrays and joining them back  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Strings may look simple, but JS gives us tons of built-in methods to work with text efficiently  
- Template literals are super useful for readable and dynamic messages  
- slice() and substring() help extract specific parts of a string  
- trim() cleans user input — extremely helpful in form validation  
- split() turns text into data, which is very powerful for processing information  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 9 completed!  
String methods made JavaScript feel even more flexible and expressive.  
I never realized how much power is hidden in simple text operations!  
Now I can format messages, clean inputs, and manipulate text like a pro. 💪  

🎯 Next Target (Day 10):
➡️ Dive into **Numbers and math methods** — solving real-world tasks using the methods I learned today!
